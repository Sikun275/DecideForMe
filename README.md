# DecideForMe

A minimalist iOS decision-making app with delivery, map, and image marking features.

## Security Note
- **Do NOT commit API keys or secrets.**
- `Secrets.xcconfig` is excluded from version control and should be kept local only.
- Each contributor must create their own `Secrets.xcconfig` with the required API keys for local development.

## Local Setup
1. Copy `Secrets.xcconfig.example` to `Secrets.xcconfig` and add your API keys.
2. Open the project in Xcode and build as usual.

## Features
- Delivery: Weighted random selection from user-input options.
- Map: Google Places API search, random selection, and map display.
- Image: Mark and randomly select points on a photo.
